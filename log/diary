he said i'm particular, not strange or else. i don't know what to think. i mean, he seems pretty busy with his work and else, and i don't know if i would get along with his style of life and else. i mean, i really like him (... i think, or maybe, if i repeat it by myself little by little i begin to believe in it). as i was saying, i think i like him, but his style of life is very different from mine, so it seems so strange to me. but he likes what he does, so i'm happy for him... i don't know what how i feel and what to think, there're just sensations and my instinct tells me many different and contraddicted things, so it's just a mess.
